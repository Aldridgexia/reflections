What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git file is added to the directory. Since I want to track every change I would make in the future.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
I have no idea yet.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Adding one logical change to the staging area at one time.
